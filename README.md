# Agentic Honeypot API

An AI-powered Agentic Honeypot system designed to detect scam intent and autonomously engage scammers in multi-turn conversations to extract actionable fraud intelligence such as UPI IDs, bank details, phishing links, and phone numbers.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of agentic AI systems for real-world cybersecurity applications. Upon detecting scam behavior, the system activates an autonomous agent that mimics human responses to prolong engagement and safely gather critical intelligence without exposing detection.

## Key Features
- Scam intent detection with confidence scoring  
- Autonomous agent-based scam engagement  
- Multi-turn conversation handling using conversation IDs  
- Structured intelligence extraction (UPI, bank, links, phone)  
- Secure API authentication using API keys  
- Publicly deployed, production-ready REST API  


## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI  
- **Architecture:** Modular agent-based design  
- **API Specification:** OpenAPI 3.1  
- **Deployment:** Render (HTTPS)

## Status
✔ Live deployment  
✔ Secure authentication  
✔ Multi-turn tested  
✔ Evaluation-ready
